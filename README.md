# DOA-AOA-algorithms
Algorithms to estimate the Direction-of-Arrival of the target signal
This project focus on sparse array (a small number of receivers) doa estimation.

The algorithms will be introduced and explained with codes as following:

1 Search-Based AOA Estimation

2 Accelerated Algorithm using Random Ferns

3 to be continued...
