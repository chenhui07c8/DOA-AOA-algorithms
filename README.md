# DOA-AOA-algorithms
Algorithms to estimate the Direction-of-Arrival of the target signal

This repostory is focusing on sparse array (a small number of receivers) doa estimation. Some of the algorithms are designed for one-dimension direction estimation. However, 1-d search can be easily extended into 2-d search by using another non parallel pair of sensor. Thus, the target direction vector in a 3-d can be obtained because the third angle info is dependent on the first two.

The algorithms will be introduced and explained with codes as following:

2 Accelerated Algorithm using Random Ferns
