# DOA-AOA-algorithms
Algorithms to estimate the Direction-of-Arrival of the target signal

This repostory is focusing on sparse array (a small number of receivers) DOA estimation. Some of the algorithms are designed for one-dimension direction estimation. However, 1D search can be easily extended into 2D search by using another non parallel pair of sensor. Thus, the target 3D direction vector can be obtained because the third angle info is dependent on the first two.

The algorithms will be introduced and explained with codes as following:
